In thie section you'll find all the cerebellar model available. The HUB leverages on the unique concept of the Brain Scaffold Builder (BSB), a modeling workflow that allows multiscale modeling of neurons, microcircuits, large-scale networks and whole brains. Although initially designed for the cerebellum, BSB can be easily applied to any brain networks through customized developments on demand. The BSB supports different modeling platforms and formats and can be applied to neuromorphic hardware, robotic control systems and virtual brain simulators. A special aspect of the HUB is to provide the infrastructure and expertise for multiscale experimental validation of the models in rodents. "
