The models are generated from and validated against experimental data at various levels, are passed through various steps of validation and simplification, and are then used to generate closed-loop robotic controllers and virtual brains. A dedicated cluster computing facility is used for data elaboration and modelling. The user can download and run the public models listed here for the cerebellum.",
